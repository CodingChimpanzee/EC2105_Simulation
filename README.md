Simulation problem

Consider a metallic rectangular box with sides 𝑎 and 𝑏 and height 𝑐.
The side walls and the bottom surface are grounded. The top surface is isolated and kept at a
constant potential 𝑉0. Determine the potential distribution inside the box. Please plot the
equipotential lines and flux lines.
